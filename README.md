g2p.give2peer.org
=================

A Symfony project created on April 1, 2015, which makes use of only one small
custom bundle, the `Give2PeerBundle`, and a lot of vendor bundles, blessed be
the `composer` community ; we love you.

This is the REST service running at [g2p.give2peer.org](http://g2p.give2peer.org).

It will provide a server for [Give2Peer](http://www.give2peer.org)'s bÃªta Android application.

It is not unit-tested, as are most APIs, but [behavior-tested](/features).
Features written in Gherkin are a breeze to write and review, they provide an
easy entry point to new contributors and they also provide documentation.


Vision
======

Bring the power of the internet of things to the sharing of things.

That is so cheesy, yes. But it's also true !
We can leverage this awesome new communication tool that internet is
to find people that need the stuff we have but don't need.

Want not, waste not.

Finally, and this is quite important, money should not be involved.


A Work in Progress
==================

These are the features we're working on :

- [X] item location, title, description, tags
- [X] item finding around coordinates
- [X] item images
- [X] list tags
- [X] geolocation through third-party services
- [X] registration
- [X] create and serve 200x200 thumbnails
- [x] user experience points and levels
- [ ] https support
- [ ] proper documentation

Right now, the database online is filled with fake/test data, so that we may
easily test the client while developing it.


The Bundle
==========

See [the bundle's README](src/Give2Peer/Give2PeerBundle/README.md).


REST
====

Expect `JSON` responses.


Authenticate
------------

Use HTTP basic auth.

Yes, we'll need https.

Authentication will still probably be subject to upgrades, like using perishable
authentication tokens instead of the user password each time.


Register
--------

Clients can register users using the following API :

`POST /register`
  - *username*
  - *password*
  - Returns the user.

See the error codes below to see what the API sends back when the username is
already taken.

This API is throttled to a fixed number of queries per day and per IP.


Give or Spot
------------

`POST /item/add`
  - *location* (mandatory)
    Multiple formats are accepted :
      - "43.578658, 1.468091"
      - "10 Rond-Point Jean Lagasse, 31400 Toulouse"
      - "91.121.148.102"
  - *title*
  - *description*
  - *gift* 'true' or 'false', whether the user is the legal owner or not



Find
----

`GET /tags`
  - returns an array of tags, with no guaranteed sorting.
  - each tag is a string of maximum 16 characters.


`GET /find/{latitude}/{longitude}/{skip}/{radius}`
  - fetches at most `128` items present around the provided coordinates,
    sorted by increasing distance, at most `radius`, and `skip` the first ones.
  - the `radius` is expected in meters, and by default is infinite.
  - the number of items to `skip` is 0 by default.
  - returns an array of items, each with the additional `distance` property.
  - each item is a full JSONed instance with as much data as we need.
  - each item provides its picture URI (get the file with a separate request)

Here is an (old) example of `JSON` sent back with two items found :

```
[
  {
    "id": 529,
    "title": "Plum maiores",
    "location": "43.59528538094, 1.4899757103897",
