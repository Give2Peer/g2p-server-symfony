A bunch of handy scripts.

The `script/behat` script should be symlinked to `bin/behat`.
We wrote a composer hook to that effect.

    
SSL KEYS
--------

    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:2048 -out /etc/apache2/ssl/give2peer.org.crt -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/give2peer.org.key

=> self-signed

We tried the tool of letsencrypt too, but we're not using it for now.
