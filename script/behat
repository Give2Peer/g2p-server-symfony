// Yeah... About that... Sorry ! If you're lucky I'll fix this someday.
// It's TOO DANGEROUS to delete the files (for now), in case the suite is
// (un)willingly run on the production server, and havoc ensues.
// Ideally, the test env should use another upload dir that we can safely
// overwrite and delete, and this would be solved.
// And if you think writing these comments took longer than to fix, think again.
// Or, hey, even better : prove it ! ;)
// ... later ...
// Wait. Didn't I solve this earlier in the big configuration refacto ? Yay ! \o/

// May break at any given time, of course. Holler me if it does !
