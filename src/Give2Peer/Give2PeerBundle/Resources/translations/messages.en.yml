# We're using YAML files, because we can leverage the tree-like structure.
# Also, XML translation files suck at being readable, and readability counts.
# I'm not sure about the `api` root node ; maybe as file name ?
# But if we go that way, why not `error` too in the file name ?

# Note : our controller `error` method implicitely prefixes with `api.error.`.
